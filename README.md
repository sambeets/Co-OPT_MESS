# Optimal mobile energy transportation: A Co-Optimization approach

This repository contains three models that demonstrate to optimize the transportation route costs of Mobile Energy Storage Systems. The Model integrates sector coupling between transportation and electricity networks to enhance overall efficiency. Each model incorporates a distinct battery degradation approach and includes two datasets: one representing a small network with seven nodes and another representing a large network with sixteen nodes.

The three models are as follows:

Model-1: Represents the Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC) battery degradation model.
Model-2: Represents the Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) battery degradation model.
Model-3: Represents a generalized battery degradation model applicable across different battery chemistries.

## Descriptions

These models demonstrate a co-optimization framework utilizing dynamic programming to optimize the transportation route costs of Mobile Energy Storage Systems. The framework integrates sector coupling between transportation and electricity networks to enhance overall efficiency. 
The proposed framework integrates traffic-aware and terrain-sensitive routing, empirical battery degradation models, and Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) to account for market uncertainties. By simultaneously optimizing travel routes, traffic constraints, battery degradation, and charging costs, the framework improves the operational efficiency of Mobile Energy Storage Systems (MESS) across diverse scenarios. 
Comparative analyses further reveal cost trade-offs and scalability considerations, providing insights into the framework’s adaptability and economic impact.
